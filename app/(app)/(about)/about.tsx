        <h1>Evan Bacon</h1>
        <p>
          I'm a software developer and artist. I started working on Expo in 2017
          with the goal to make mobile content easy to create, share, and
          discover. Previously, I worked as the sole design technologist on the
          SiriusXM (360L) in-car and mobile experiences. Before software
          development, I was an award-winning Lego artist, specializing in
          life-sized sculptures.

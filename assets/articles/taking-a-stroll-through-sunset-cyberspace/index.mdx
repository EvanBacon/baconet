## Taking a stroll through Sunset Cyberspace

At my last job I had to work on a Xamarin project — it was such an intense nightmare. I would come home everyday, and just like any moody teenager I started writing a poetic anti-tribute to fight the system.

As you can tell by this article, I'm not much of a writer, so instead I built an Expo app. Over the course of [3 angsty nights](https://twitter.com/Baconbrix/status/915951734769508353) I produced a game called [Expo Sunset Cyberspace](https://expo.io/@bacon/cyberspace): a ballad of the ultra master [Charlie Cheever](https://twitter.com/ccheever) and his battle to end subpar cross-platform native development platforms.

## The Story

The game spins a tall tale about when the evil Xamaronions inexplicably transported [Brent Vatne](https://twitter.com/notbrent) and [Nikhilesh Sigatapu](https://medium.com/@s.nikhilesh) to Xamaronia (or whatever made up name I came up with). Then a tall masculine shadow emerges from the darkness (of a fully neon world 🤷‍). When Brent and Nikki inquire about this neo-warrior's identity, he's revealed to be — The Man, The Myth, The Legend, [Charlie Cheever](https://twitter.com/ccheever). A revelation that can only be summarized as “😮😮😮😮😮😮😮”. Charlie then teaches how they must collect Exponium, a… mystical instrument type thing, I guess? (I don't know, I didn't really think that far ahead.) Anyways you get the point, it's incredible! 😅

## Gameplay

The game is pretty simple: you drag your finger around the screen collecting Exponium and avoiding spikes. Notice how very little overlaps with the story, in a nod to the classic confusing games, like [Night Trap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Night_Trap).

The game also incorporates massive amounts of natural human psychology: the spikes are red.

## A React Native Tutorial

One of the coolest parts of ARKit is its ability to spot and stick to surfaces. Today we‚Äôre going to talk about how to do this with React Native.

## Getting Started

This tutorial assumes you‚Äôre familiar with:

- React Native

- Expo.AR

- Sparrow migration patterns

Go ahead and open the [starter project](https://snack.expo.io/@bacon/ar-hit-test-starter) as we quickly cover what‚Äôs provided in the starter:

### Touchable View

This view will wrap the ReactNative.PanResponder and allow us to just pass in a `onTouchesBegan` prop (holla at a iOS native dev). If you‚Äôre curious about how the PanResponder works, check out [the docs](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/panresponder.html).

Or forget that noise and just use the much better [GestureHandler](https://docs.expo.io/versions/latest/sdk/gesture-handler).

### Basic AR Scene

This is a generic three.js scene (learn more about this in my [past AR tutorials](https://blog.expo.io/arkit-in-react-native-tutorial-the-basics-9f839539f0b9).) three.js is the super popular 3D framework we use to render things in Expo.

## Coding Stuff

We‚Äôll just be working in the `onTouchesBegan` function in the `App.js`. This function will be invoked when `onPanResponderGrant` is called in the `TouchableView` .

```js
onTouchesBegan = async ({ locationX: x, locationY: y }) => {
  // 1.
  if (!this.renderer) {
    return;
  }

  // Get the size of the renderer
  const size = this.renderer.getSize();

  // 2.
  const { hitTest } = await AR.performHitTest(
    {
      x: x / size.width,
      y: y / size.height,
    },
    // 3.
    AR.HitTestResultTypes.HorizontalPlane
  );
};
```

1. Prevent doing anything if the scene hasn‚Äôt been built yet.

1. To use the AR hit test function to invoke the [native function](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/arkit/arframe/2875718-hittest?language=objc), we also need to pass in a normalized point. Ex: { x: 0.5, y: 0.5} is the center of the screen; {x: 0, y: 0} is the top left of the screen.

1. We need to pass in the `HitTestResultTypes` that we want to get. For this we‚Äôll use [HorizontalPlane](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/arkit/arhittestresulttype/arhittestresulttypeestimatedhorizontalplane?language=objc).

```js
// 1.
for (let hit of hitTest) {
  const { worldTransform } = hit;
  // 2.
  if (this.cube) {
    this.scene.remove(this.cube);
  }

  // 3.
  const geometry = new THREE.BoxGeometry(0.0254, 0.0254, 0.0254);
  const material = new THREE.MeshPhongMaterial({
    color: 0x00ff00,
  });
  this.cube = new THREE.Mesh(geometry, material);
  // Add the cube to the scene
  this.scene.add(this.cube);

  // 4.
  this.cube.matrixAutoUpdate = false;

  const matrix = new THREE.Matrix4();
  matrix.fromArray(worldTransform);

  // 5.
  this.cube.applyMatrix(matrix);
  this.cube.updateMatrix();
}
```

1. Traverse the hit test results using a `for loop` and deconstruct the worldTransform from the hit.

1. If the scene already contains a cube (second tap), then we need to remove it,

1. Create a three.js cube with a green material and add the cube to the scene.

1. Turn off the auto matrix update, create a new Matrix 4 and convert the matrix array that was returned. The matrix array is an array of 16 numbers (4x4).

1. Finally we will apply the matrix to the cube and manually update the cube.

A quick note on the Matrix4: a matrix represents the position, scale, and orientation ‚Äî so basically just everything. :]

Anyways that‚Äôs all I‚Äôve got for hit testing. I hope you learned something special! ‚ù§ ü¶Ñ

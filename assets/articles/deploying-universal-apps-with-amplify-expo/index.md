# Deploying Universal Apps with Amplify & Expo

##

Since we announced [Expo for web](https://blog.expo.io/expo-cli-and-sdk-web-support-beta-d0c588221375), lots of exciting new ideas have been flying around! One of my favorites is the combination of [Expo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQI9aUlouMI) and [Amplify](https://aws-amplify.github.io/docs/) to create full-stack universal applications. Thanks to [Nikhil Swaminathan](https://twitter.com/TheSwaminator) and [James Ide](https://twitter.com/JI), Amplify now automatically detects if your environment is using Expo, and will generate then serve a static website on AWS! Meaning you can get your Expo web app running immediately. üî•

_Note: Expo for web is currently still in beta_.

## **Deploying to Amplify**

- Ensure you have the latest version of [Expo CLI](https://github.com/expo/expo-cli): `npm install -g expo-cli`.

- Open an existing Expo project, or create a new one with `expo init`.

- Run `expo start --web` to ensure everything is set up correctly. If Expo web is still in beta, you‚Äôll probably be prompted to run `yarn add react-native-web react-dom` and add the `"web"` field to the `platforms` array in the `app.json`.

- After this, you can commit your changes to the branch you want to deploy from.

- Now create a git repo and link it on [Amplify‚Äôs web dashboard](http://aws.amazon.com/amplify). For this example (and everything else), I‚Äôll be using Github.

After you‚Äôve linked the repo, you can specify which branch you want to deploy from. Then, every time you commit to this branch, it‚Äôll trigger a rebuild and Amplify will automatically republish your changes.

Just in case you hit a wall, this is what my project overview page looks like:

![Notice how AWS auto-detected Expo. üòÅ](./images/1kgSMlZxlL2G1phSwEmDh2g.png)_Notice how AWS auto-detected Expo. üòÅ_

At this point Amplify will publish your first build by cloning the repo into a docker image. This could take a few minutes; if you scroll down on that page you can watch the progress.

![You can also move between builds and redeploy them.](./images/1XA8_1vjcpwd14dcRddFKRg.png)_You can also move between builds and redeploy them._

## **Finally if you click on the ‚ÄúDomain‚Äù link you should see the following:**

## **This is what you should actually see**

[Here is the live version](https://master.d33alyqvzb76gi.amplifyapp.com/)

That‚Äôs the basics of deploying your app with Amplify! Now you can start adding awesome services that work in both web and native ‚Äîlike [authentication with \*\*Cognito](https://github.com/dabit3/expo-user-authentication)**!

# Expo Doodle Jump

My first ever conference workshop was at React Europe, my best friend and collegue (unnamed canadian) was giving a workshop, and had mentioned earlier that day that I could do a short bit on gaming with Expo. I had no resources and no idea how to fill that kind of time (I still don't -- workshops are hard).

I quickly stood up a clone of the popular Doodle Jump game. This was a good example of Expo because it required smooth graphics, and fast device sensor input (for moving the character).

My bit in the workshop went over with the grace of an atomic bomb. I still cringe about it when lying in bed at night. Was rushed, too much content, and generally confusing. Luckily the audience was great and forgot about it as quickly as I rushed through it.

## Universal Expo

A few years later, I created Expo for web. This was a great opportunity to revisit the Doodle Jump game and make it universal. You can now play it on any platform where Expo runs!

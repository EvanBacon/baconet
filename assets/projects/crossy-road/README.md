# Exponent: Crossy Road

The day was Monday, June 5th 2017, I came home from work where I was running point as the design technologist for the new SiriusXM mobile app. Normally I didn't come home until close to midnight, but these last few weeks had been different. Under tense constraints, I discovered a breakthrough new technology Exponent which I had completely rewritten the Sirius prototype in.

It was instantly clear that this software was disruptive and powerful. So much so that I was leaving work at normal hours so I could explore building truly native apps with JavaScript and sharing them instantly with anyone via the Expo client app.

I had previously stuck to making small personal projects but it was hard to resist the urge to build something bigger. I had been playing Crossy Road on the bus to work for a while and I thought it would be a great game to recreate in React Native.

When I would say Exponent is good, people didn't quite understand. I rebuilt the entire core mechanic and a number of supplementary screens in the span of just a couple red bulls.

I sent it to a few friends instantly via [the Expo client](https://expo.dev/@bacon/crossy-road) and they were convinced it was the real game, emulating in some sort of less-than-reputable way (we were teenagers and enjoyed a fair amount of online streaming).

Was trying to get into open source so I pushed the code to GitHub and tweeted it out on tech Twitter (a concept I had only recently discovered).

The tweet did exceptionally well for me, a total of 50 likes and retweets from some notable developers (Charlie Cheever, Brent Vatne, James Ide, Ken Wheeler, and a few others)...

I followed up later that day with an instant update which [enabled playing as Brent, Ide, and Nikki](https://twitter.com/Baconbrix/status/872145992497475584?s=20&t=o0_EA6qJCGxRMCJdTd3FdQ).

Now in retrospect, I probably shouldn't have tagged the creators of the original game, but I figured that they and Exponent would be excited to see this unique use-case.

I tweeted the game on June 6th at 12:20 PM, at 9:13 PM I got a response from the creators of Crossy Road, they were less than pleased.

Hi Evan,

I am a representative of Hipster Whale, creators of Crossy Road, you might have heard of it? :)

We appreciate your enthusiasm for our IP, and don't want to put emerging game devs off practising their craft, but the thing is, Crossy Road, the game and its assets, are our baby. I'm sure when you have a signature game you'd feel the same about others using your IP without permission.

Please remove your Crossy Road clone, and sorry we haven't e-met under different circumstances.

I look forward to hearing from you and getting this resolved.

Warm regards,

Giselle Rosman

Immediately I thought "hmm, perhaps I shouldn't have spent the last few years establishing myself as an artist who replicates popular superheroes in Lego bricks." then I remembered I essentially have never made any money off any replication work.

Utilizing the power of Exponent I quickly changed the name of the app and a number of the assets until it looked like one of the standard copycat games on the App Store (where integrity is second to A/G profits). Entire process only took a couple minutes.

Two days later I got a follow up email:

```
Hi again Evan,

I do look forward to hearing from you. We noticed you've changed the name of your game, but are still using our assets etc.

We really do appreciate that you've probably put a fair amount of work into your project. If it's for a class or educational purposes, if you could find somewhere private to host it, and let us know, we'd be cool with that.

While we get it may be a fun project for you, we have to make sure there are no products out there using direct copies of our assets and potentially being confused for the real thing. I'd prefer to work this out directly with you than issue a DMCA to expo.io, if I don't hear from you you leave me with no alternatives.

Thanks for your time and I look forward to hearing from you soon.

Warm regards,

Giselle

At this point, I didn't work at Exponent, and had no intention of joining. I figured if they could so elegantly solve the problem of sharing code between iOS and Android, they could probably solve this problem too lol. I did send a heads up message to the developers, who expressed their support for the project. After they pointed out that the claim was frivolous, I decided to take the high road and ... send a snarky reply.

```
Giselle,

Nice to meet you, I‚Äôm glad you like my personal project, demonstrating OpenGL ES for the people I teach.

Sorry for the belated response, I‚Äôve been busy lately.
I can appreciate the protection of your trademarks, loss of brand recognition is a pain (thermos, coke, frogger, ect‚Ä¶)

I worked on rearranging my assets in a more agreeable way last night. I believe I took down about 75% of my similar assets.
I‚Äôll make sure to get it to a standard `frog type game` tonight, as well as unlisting the url.
I cannot delete a url off of expo, so I‚Äôll probably just publish a picture of someone shrugging (I‚Äôm open to suggestions if you have a good one).

Just to put your mind at ease, for my tutorial the project will look much different.

My todo list looks roughly like:
Replace models with cubes
Pull down demo gif from repo
shrugging guy thing I mentioned early
change url to unlisted so it doesn‚Äôt appear publicly
adjust camera aperture / position
other stuff, if it doesn‚Äôt strike me as avant garde

I believe that your name isn‚Äôt in use (not crossy road, hipster whale, or giselle for that matter).
I pulled the assets that share similarities with your characters, so I‚Äôm assuming your talking about the trees and cars or something‚Ä¶
‚Äî‚Äî

Of course I should probably add that I do this for fun and don‚Äôt make money from it (not searching for a pity party (I have a ‚Äúreal‚Äù job too) ), I also don‚Äôt currently have any apps on the store that I‚Äôm cross promoting.
Just helping keep the online community educated.

Hoping we can still be e-friends! ‚ù§Ô∏èüòÅ

I had every intention of doing these things but they never replied, so I just kinda forgot about it.

So anyways, this is how I became the [official creator of Crossy Road](https://twitter.com/_kingofnull/status/953917874149638144?s=20&t=o0_EA6qJCGxRMCJdTd3FdQ). I've since become a full-time open-source developer (MIT licenses and such).

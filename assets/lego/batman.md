# Lego Batman

My first life-size Lego sculpture. Batman has always been my favorite super hero and I wanted to pay tribute to him in a unique way.

I love the uniformity of Lego bricks, creating smooth lines using sharp edges was something I wanted to explore.

I built the sculpture when I was twelve years old, using thousands of Lego bricks. Originally I built the sculpture unglued, but I quickly realized that the sculpture would not survive the weight of the bricks. I then glued the bricks together, but I was not satisfied with the results. The sculpture was too heavy and the glue was not strong enough to hold the bricks together. I then constructed a counterweight system internally to mitigate the weight of the sculpture.

The sculpture was displayed at the first ever Lego convention in Austin Texas: Brick Fiesta. I mentioned to many people that I was going to build a life-size Lego sculpture, but as you can imagine it seemed quite untenable for a child to follow through on. The unveiling was a surprise to everyone who saw it.

Many local news stations and blogs covered the conference, and I was interviewed by a number of people. The first piece of content ever written about me on the internet said something along the lines of "Evan Bacon is Fucking Awesome", which was probably the nicest thing anyone had ever said about me.

I recall people asking what I had planned to make next, which I actually hadn't even thought about. I was just happy to have made it through the process of building the first sculpture. Of course, I promised a number of other sculptures were in the works -- this kicked off my now long career as of making public promises to ensure I follow through on my projects.
